## Notes
### Types of questions:
* Descriptive analysis
Describe what data looks like using e.g. graphs, charts etc. Aim is not to do any conclusions
* Exploratory analysis
You can find new correlations. There is connections but the real causal link is not checked in any detail yet.
* Inferential analysis
Generalize findings from a small sample to a larger population. Most common goal of data analysis.
* Predictive analysis
Try to use previous observation to predict the next one. Simple model and a lot of data tend to work well.
* Causal analysis
How the change of one variable changes others. Usually done via randomized experiments (at least in medicine)
* Mechanistic analysis
Looking for exact relationships. Physical or engineering models.

### What is data?
* "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items"
* data.gov
* Remember to have a question to answer. Question before data.

### Big data?
* Data is everywhere today
* The right data is more important than the size of data.

### Experimental design
* figshare.com for larger data sets instead of github
* Obama's randomized website to decide which version attracted more donations
* Spurious correlation: ice cream and drownings
* Prediction usually requires enough difference in the population distributions to distinguish from which distribution the observation came from
