## SQLite
These are just my personal to collect my thoughts in one place
* SQL - Structured Query Language 
* used to store and hadle data in databases
* Tables are the basic unit where the data is stored. 
* Observations on the row and variables in the columns


### Some commands
* CREATE TABLE
* INSERT INTO
* SELECT \* FROM <>
* UPDATE
* ALTER TABLE
* DELETE FROM
